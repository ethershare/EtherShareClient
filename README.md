# EtherShareClient

> EtherShare is a contract to share information with permanent storage and open access.

EtherShareClient consists of EtherShareLocal and [nwjs](https://nwjs.io/).  
If you are seeking for a more decentralized usage instead of visisting the website, you can download EtherShareClient and run it on your personal computer.

This client is still working in progress.  
For the alpha version, just unzip the `EtherShareClient-win-x64.zip` then click the `run.bat`.

Thanks...
